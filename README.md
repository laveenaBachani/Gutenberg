# Gutenberg
Interesting analysis on some of the most famous literature works while honing our skills working with strings, arrays, hash tables, trees, and more!


Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/) is a massive online effort to digitize and archive popular books as a way to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks. Over 57,000 of the worldâ€™s greatest literature have been digitized. 

Many of these digitized works have been added to the GITenberg github repo (https://github.com/GITenberg/). 

We will perform some interesting test analysis operations on it.
